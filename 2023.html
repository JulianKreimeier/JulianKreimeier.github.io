                                Human cognition relies on embodiment as a fundamental mechanism. Virtual avatars allow
                                users to experience the adaptation, control, and perceptual illusion of alternative
                                bodies. Although virtual bodies have medical applications in motor rehabilitation and
                                therapeutic interventions, their potential for learning anatomy and medical
                                communication remains underexplored. For learners and patients, anatomy, procedures, and
                                medical imaging can be abstract and difficult to grasp. Experiencing anatomies,
                                injuries, and treatments virtually through one's own body could be a valuable tool for
                                fostering understanding. This work investigates the impact of avatars displaying anatomy
                                and injuries suitable for such medical simulations. We ran a user study utilizing a
                                skeleton avatar and virtual injuries, comparing to a healthy human avatar as a baseline.
                                We evaluate the influence on embodiment, well-being, and presence with self-report
                                questionnaires, as well as motor performance via an arm movement task. Our results show
                                that while both anatomical representation and injuries increase feelings of eeriness,
                                there are no negative effects on embodiment, well-being, presence, or motor performance.
                                These findings suggest that virtual representations of anatomy and injuries are suitable
                                for medical visualizations targeting learning or communication without significantly
                                affecting users' mental state or physical control within the simulation.
