                            Human cognition relies on embodiment as a fundamental mechanism. Virtual avatars allow
                            users to experience the adaptation, control, and perceptual illusion of alternative
                            bodies. Although virtual bodies have medical applications in motor rehabilitation and
                            therapeutic interventions, their potential for learning anatomy and medical
                            communication remains underexplored. For learners and patients, anatomy, procedures, and
                            medical imaging can be abstract and difficult to grasp. Experiencing anatomies,
                            injuries, and treatments virtually through one's own body could be a valuable tool for
                            fostering understanding. This work investigates the impact of avatars displaying anatomy
                            and injuries suitable for such medical simulations. We ran a user study utilizing a
                            skeleton avatar and virtual injuries, comparing to a healthy human avatar as a baseline.
                            We evaluate the influence on embodiment, well-being, and presence with self-report
                            questionnaires, as well as motor performance via an arm movement task. Our results show
                            that while both anatomical representation and injuries increase feelings of eeriness,
                            there are no negative effects on embodiment, well-being, presence, or motor performance.
                            These findings suggest that virtual representations of anatomy and injuries are suitable
                            for medical visualizations targeting learning or communication without significantly
                            affecting users' mental state or physical control within the simulation.

                            To foster the understanding of the consequences of one’s actions on climate change, low-threshold accessible and understandable content is needed. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a valuable tool in the field of sustainable development education. However, there remains a lack of practical approaches and empirical insights into fostering climate change awareness through an eco-embodiment perspective. Our prototype addresses this gap by immersing users in a VR experience that simulates an everyday life scenario. The player’s activities are calculated as if the entire population of Earth would exhibit such a behavior. At the end of the simulation, they are presented with the long-term scaled global consequences for the environment. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this communication method but also reveals necessary gameplay optimizations toward longitudinal pre/post studies to quantify users’ learning and behavioral changes.
