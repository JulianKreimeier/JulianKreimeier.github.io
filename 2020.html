                            Although most readers associate the term virtual reality (VR) with visually appealing entertainment content, this technology also promises to be helpful to disadvantaged people like blind or visually impaired people. While overcoming physical objects' and spaces' limitations, virtual objects and environments that can be spatially explored have a particular benefit. To give readers a complete, clear and concise overview of current and past publications on touchable and walkable audio supplemented VR applications for blind and visually impaired users, this survey paper presents a high-level taxonomy to cluster the work done up to now from the perspective of technology, interaction and application. In this respect, we introduced a classification into small-, medium- and large-scale virtual environments to cluster and characterize related work. Our comprehensive table shows that especially grounded force feedback devices for haptic feedback ("small scale") were strongly researched in different applications scenarios and mainly from an exocentric perspective, but there are also increasingly physically ("medium scale") or avatar-walkable ("large scale") egocentric audio-haptic virtual environments. In this respect, novel and widespread interfaces such as smartphones or nowadays consumer grade VR components represent a promising potential for further improvements. Our survey paper provides a database on related work to foster the creation process of new ideas and approaches for both technical and methodological aspects.

                            While becoming more and more aware of the ongoing climate change, eco-friendly means of transport for all citizens are moving further into focus. In order to be able to implement specific measures, it is necessary to better understand and emphasize sustainable transportation like walking and cycling through focused research. When developing novel traffic concepts and urban spaces for non-motorized traffic participants like bicycles and pedestrians, traffic and urban planning must be focused on their needs. To provide rare qualitative factors (such as stress, the perception of time and attractiveness of the environment) in this context, we present an audiovisual VR bicycle simulator which allows the user to cycle through a virtual urban environment by physically pedaling and also steering. Virtual Reality (VR) is a suitable tool in this context, as study participants find identical and almost freely definable (virtual) urban spaces with adjustable traffic scenarios. Our preliminary prototype proved to be promising and will be further optimized and evaluated.
