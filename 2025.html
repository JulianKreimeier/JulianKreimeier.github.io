                            Augmented reality (AR) offers innovative possibilities to support assembly processes, particularly in highly specialized environments such as operating rooms. This paper investigates how ambient aware color adaptation can improve the readability and usability of assembly instructions. Based on existing challenges in color perception in optical see-through AR displays, an algorithm is developed and empirically evaluated that dynamically adapts the contrast of the menu background color to the physical environment. The implementation uses the HoloLens 2 and is based on a modified Michelson contrast calculation to ensure the best visibility of instructions in bright environments. The method is evaluated by a user study in which eight participants performed an assembly task under different lighting conditions. The results show that adaptive color matching had no significant disadvantages for usability, while general AR interaction and control were perceived as more challenging.

                            Objective: Extended reality (XR) teleconsultation is used in surgery and medical emergencies, employing various technological approaches that differ in accuracy, timeliness, and user preference.
                            We conducted a systematic literature review following  PRISMA. We searched the databases IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, ACM and added an additional manual search. In total, we found 187 studies and included 14 in our review.
                            Conclusion: Our findings highlight the widespread use of video-based streaming and 3D reconstruction based on static RGB-D sensor. We found limitations in the reconstruction quality, where existing work would benefit from high-quality rendering. Interaction via annotations is common, addressing key usability needs for various surgeries and emergency situations. A standardized evaluation for interaction techniques would be beneficial for comparability. Our findings hold significant implications for improving teleconsultation and evaluation of XR telemedicine approaches.

                            New tools in machine and artificial intelligence (AI) enable personalized treatments, precise diagnostics, optimized surgical planning, and effective monitoring. By leveraging large AI models and integrating data from sources such as imaging, wearables, and text records, novel opportunities arise for preventive risk assessment, individualized therapy decisions, and intraoperative assistance systems. These developments have the potential to reduce staff workload and improve quality of care along the treatment pathway. In this article, we describe several current technological developments, outline future perspectives, and provide a contextual assessment.
