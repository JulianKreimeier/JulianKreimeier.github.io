                            To achieve the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Climate Agreement, it is of great importance to promote environmentally friendly means of transport. In urban areas, shifting motorized trips to active transport modes (i.e., walking and cycling) is essential. Therefore, knowledge of walking and cycling is indispensable for planning and policy, which is the basis for targeted promotion of active forms of mobility. This paper aims to identify factors that specifically influence cycling and to derive recommendations for action for planning and policy in a virtual testbed. Specifically, the influence of traffic planning measures (i.e., structural infrastructure facilities for stationary and moving traffic as well as traffic regulations) and urban design measures (i.e., the design of public space) on the promotion of cycling will be shown. For this purpose, a virtual reality simulation was used, independent of different external conditions during field surveys and the necessity of time-, cost- and regulation-intensive structural changes. Using an improved bicycle simulator, 93 people cycled through 20 variations of an approximately 680 m long road section, surveying the effect of selected traffic planning and urban design parameters. Special attention was paid to the subjective safety of the cyclists and the attractiveness of the urban environment. Furthermore, three types of infrastructure were differentiated: No bicycle infrastructure (riding on the roadway), a bicycle lane, and a structurally separated cycle path next to the sidewalk. The virtual road section represented a real location. In addition to the findings gained from the physiological optimization of the simulator, the results show that roadside greenery had the highest effectiveness in terms of subjective safety and attractiveness. Other factors with a high influence were a speed reduction from 50 to 30 km/h when riding on the roadway with cars and the red coloring of the bicycle lane, each increasing the perception of safety. In contrast, a lack of a boundary line between the cycle path and the sidewalk was unsettling for those who rarely or never ride bicycles in their daily lives. In addition, restaurant and recreation areas increased the attractiveness of the road section, although entailing a lower perception of safety. Other factors, such as motor vehicle traffic volume or vehicles parked at the roadside, showed no significant effects on the evaluation of cycling.
                            With the help of these findings, the consequences of traffic planning and urban design measures can be better assessed in subsequent virtual testbeds. Also, initial trends can be identified as to which planning instruments should be used as a priority to promote cycling in urban areas. Future work should validate the transfer of these insights into physical urban spaces to support further the mid-term transformation towards sustainable urban mobility using scientific evidence.

                            People with special needs like blind and visually impaired (BVI) people can particularly benefit from using voice assistants providing spoken information input and output in everyday life. However, it is crucial to understand their needs and include them in developing accessible and useful assistance systems. By conducting an online survey with 146 BVI people, this paper revealed that common voice assistants like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa are used by a majority of BVI people and are also considered helpful. In particular, features in audio entertainment, internet access, and everyday life practical things like weather queries, time-related information (e.g., setting an alarm clock), checking calendar entries, and taking notes are particularly often used and appreciated. The participants also indicated that the integration of smart home devices, the optimization of existing functionalities, and voice input are important. Still, also potentially negative aspects such as data privacy and data security are relevant. Therefore, it seems particularly interesting to implement offline data processing as far as possible. Our results contribute to this development by providing an overview of empirically collected requirements for functions and implementation-related aspects.

                            Tactile models, such as floor plans of a familiar or unfamiliar environment, can be helpful for people with visual impairments to grasp and interpret spatial information. Such plans are usually fabricated physically in a time-consuming process and are not interactive. This paper suggests presenting tactile floor plans using surface haptic feedback on an electrostatic display to overcome these limitations. Besides audiohaptically exploring tactile floor plans, our prototype also allows for voice interaction and demonstrates the control of smart home devices in this context. The evaluation was conducted in two stages with eight participants with visual impairments: First, it was investigated how individual rooms can be identified and assigned with electrostatic tactile feedback over a common dot matrix display. Second, the generation of a mental map when exploring an interactive detailed floor plan with several rooms was evaluated. Our results show that electrostatic haptic feedback enables people with visual impairments to recognize and understand graphic elements like rooms and a floor plan. However, this entails significantly more time for exploration and a higher cognitive workload when compared to a comparable but more expensive dot matrix display, though spatial and semantic smart home contextual information can be added through a voice interface, such as "What is the room's name I am touching?" or "Turn on the power socket in this room." Our preliminary but innovative approach reveals the initial potential of electrostatic feedback for accessibility and aims to help situate the opportunities and challenges in this context for wider dissemination.

                            Many streets and buildings are not accessible for wheelchair users, which impedes a major challenge for their mobility. Often, such challenges can be considered during the planning stage, which is why it is important to include this user group in the planning process. Ideally, these planning efforts should also be made visually and haptically navigable using Virtual Reality (VR) technology to allow for better imagination, accurate conclusions, and awareness of wheelchair users. This work optimizes previous approaches so that different roadway conditions can be made haptically perceptible. The proposed prototype provides a non-contact and adjustable brake for simulating inclined planes, which can be adjusted depending on personal and environmental parameters. In addition, it can simulate roads such as cobblestones using a tactile transducer. The individually optimized components were combined into a complete VR system and integrated into a virtual environment for evaluation. The qualitative and quantitative results showed that realistic simulation is possible, but further development steps towards holistic and dissemination-capable hardware and software are needed. To this end, our contribution aims to improve the long-term involvement of wheelchair users in planning processes and increase awareness of their mobility situation.

                            Assistive technologies help blind and visually impaired people to manage their daily lives independently. However, they usually have to work with voice user interfaces to use smartphones and tablets. Tasks like managing the calendar, taking notes, or setting an alarm clock require reliable voice recognition, which entails online access for remote computing. However, apart from data privacy and security issues, an online connection is not available in any situation. In this regard, our paper develops and evaluates an offline voice user interface with offline speech processing. The voice assistant was tested with seven blind and visually impaired people. It was found that the assistant was very well received (i.e., pragmatic, hedonic, and general quality) and that no functional limitations could be perceived due to the offline data processing. Based on these findings, the scope of functionality and the level of detail of the evaluation can be extended further to adapt this technology for this specific user group and promote its dissemination.

                            Digitalization in the field of education for sustainable development (ESD) has gained attention in the last decade. In particular, technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) offer new ways to deliver educational content on sustainable development by simulating real-world experiences and using immersive and interactive formats for learning. Using an explorative qualitative research approach, the benefits of AR and VR technologies in the context of ESD are assessed. The results of a first expert panel show that AR and VR technologies are particularly suitable for sustainability topics when an understanding of action and the transfer of knowledge and values are to be promoted among learners.
