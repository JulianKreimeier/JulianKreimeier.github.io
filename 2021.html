                            Ambient intelligence represents a paradigm in which the user does not react to the environment, but vice versa. Accordingly, smart environments can react to the presence and activities of users and support them unobtrusively from the background. Especially in the context of accessibility, this offers great potential that has so far only been demonstrated for individual user groups. To overcome this limitation, we propose the automated, user- and context-related adaptation of the modality as well as locality of the representation of building information in the form of both an adjustable table as well as two displays on the basis of a prototype for a library information center. For being independent from material and regulatory restrictions and for better planability (especially with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) we used in addition to the hardware components also a Virtual Reality simulation, which proved to be very useful. Further optimization and evaluation will be needed for a more in depth understanding and dissemination in the long run, yet our prototype aims to help fostering further activities in the field of ambient intelligence, accessibility and virtual reality as a planning tool.

                            Virtual Reality (VR) is attracting more and more attention from academic research and practical application with the current availability of low-cost and end-user friendly devices. In terms of haptic (rather than visual) interaction, however, this technology is still in its infancy and there are few devices that are inexpensive and technologically simple to operate, respectively to procure. In this context, we present a concept of how haptic interaction with VR data gloves can also succeed by means of a commercially available web cam, sophisticated tracking software, and homemade low-cost hardware. All hardware and software components are to be obtained inexpensively or are open-source in order to achieve the greatest possible dissemination potential. With this work, we intend to provide an important trigger for future improvements and dissemination in terms of both technology and areas of application.

                            As access to new technologies becomes increasingly less expensive and complex, technologies such as virtual reality (VR) are also becoming interesting and relevant for applications outside consumer entertainment. Especially with VR for blind and visually impaired people, VR can overcome the limitations of real-world environments (e.g., hazardous locations and reliance on sighted companionship for training) by virtually exploring its digital model using consumer hardware. In this context, we conducted two within-subject user study with 11 and 5 participants that were asked to learn and re-walk an audio-landmark enriched path in a virtual environment. Our results showed, that the ability to learn and re-walk an audio landmark-enriched environment using an auditive only locomotion interface is possible, but yet difficult. To be able to re-walk even a simple corridor entails a relatively big training effort, but distinctive structures are recognizable again. The results also indicated that the intuitive use of controller based locomotion brings advantages over a keyboard and mouse based approach. Furthermore, we discovered different characteristics of auditive navigation (e.g., walking zigzag, in circles or collision-oriented with regard to the rooms' walls), encountered acoustic rendering problems in acute corners and were able to show a training effect when having trained a path within a virtual environment with respect to re-walking, both inside a virtual environment and outside to a physically re-walked path. This work underlines the feasibility, problems, but also chances of different locomotion implementations in VR and is intended to foster future work towards both technical and methodological optimization in this area.
